# Write a method mutual_factors that accepts any amount of numbers as arguments. The method should return an array containing all of the common divisors shared among the arguments. For example, the common divisors of 50 and 30 are 1, 2, 5, 10. You can assume that all of the arguments are positive integers.

def mutual_factors(*numbers)
  min = numbers.min
  divisors = []

  (1..min).each do |factor|
    if numbers.all? { |number| number % factor == 0 }
      divisors << factor
    end
  end

  divisors

p mutual_factors(50, 30, 45, 105)   # [1, 5]
p mutual_factors(8, 4)              # [1, 2, 4]
p mutual_factors(8, 4, 10)          # [1, 2]
p mutual_factors(12, 24)            # [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]

p mutual_factors(7)                 # [1, 7]
p mutual_factors(7, 9)              # [1]
