# Write a method perfect_square? that accepts a number as an argument. The method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the argument is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the product of some number multiplied by itself. For example, since 64 = 8 * 8 and 144 = 12 * 12, 64 and 144 are perfect squares; 35 is not a perfect square.


def perfect_square?(number)
  sqrt = Integer.sqrt(number)
  sqrt * sqrt == number
end

p perfect_square?(1)     # true
p perfect_square?(4)     # true
p perfect_square?(64)    # true
p perfect_square?(100)   # true
p perfect_square?(169)   # true
p perfect_square?(2)     # false
p perfect_square?(40)    # false
p perfect_square?(32)    # false
p perfect_square?(50)    # false
